## Description
This is a backend server set up using mongoDB. The api routes and server were set up and can be called using an api tester like postman or insomnia. There are 3 different parts to this: `User`, `Thoughts`, and `Reactions`. Users can be created and Users can 'friend' other users, but more like a twitter follow. One side following doesnt mean that the other side follows back. The Thoughts are bound to the users and have a unique ID each. You can create reactions to each thought by id. all items can be deleted as well and updated.
